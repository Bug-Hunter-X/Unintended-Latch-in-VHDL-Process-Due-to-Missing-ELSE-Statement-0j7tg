This repository demonstrates a common VHDL coding error that leads to an unintended latch. The code in `bug.vhdl` shows a process where the `data_out` signal is only assigned a value inside an `IF` statement. If the condition is false, the signal retains its previous value, effectively creating a latch.  The solution in `bugSolution.vhdl` provides the corrected code, ensuring that the `data_out` signal is always assigned a value within the process, regardless of the `IF` condition. This prevents the unintended latch and ensures predictable behavior.
